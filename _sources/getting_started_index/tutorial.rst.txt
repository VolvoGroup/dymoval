Tutorial
========

Now that you learned what is meant with model validation you can play around with *Dymoval*.
The best way to take familiarity with *Dymoval* is to run any tutorial by typing

.. code-block::

    import dymoval as dmv
    dmv.open_tutorial()

It copies a Jupyter notebook named
dymoval_tutorial.ipynb from your installation folder
to your home folder and it will try to open it.

If a dymoval_tutorial.ipynb file already exists in your home
folder, it will be overwritten.

Be sure that you have an app that can open .ipynb files.
